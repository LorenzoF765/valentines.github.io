# For Charlotte

## Introduction

This is a GitHub Pages project that I developed for my girlfriend Charlotte. She is an amazing person, and I wanted to create something special to show my appreciation for her. I hope she enjoys this little gift as much as I enjoyed making it. If you're looking for a meaningful way to celebrate someone special, feel free to use this as inspiration.

## Development

This project combines various web technologies to create a personalized experience:

- **HTML & CSS**: Designed with a nature-themed aesthetic, focusing on darker greens and lighter, nature-inspired colors for a cohesive look.
- **JavaScript**: Includes a custom Flappy Bird game with adjusted difficulty and a start button, incorporating a countdown before the game begins. The game is designed to be more user-friendly and suitable for mobile devices.
- **Spotify Integration**: Replaced the previous heart image with an embedded Spotify player, allowing users to listen to a selected track directly from the page.
- **Vanta.js**: For the animated background, I used the Vanta.js library with the "clouds" effect, adding a dynamic and visually appealing element to the page.

I utilized a straightforward approach with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, ensuring that the code is easy to follow and modify. I've added comments to the code to help you understand how different components come together.
